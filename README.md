# Research-Paper--Migration-to-Cloud

This research paper focuses on requirement engineering for cloud data migration, a critical process for transferring information, application data, and services to the cloud. As cloud requirements evolve over time, it is essential to understand these dynamic needs to ensure a smooth migration process. The success of cloud data migration is largely dependent on meticulous planning and thorough analysis, which involves identifying various factors such as application requirements, security needs, cost considerations, and alignment with business objectives.

The paper emphasizes the importance of gathering and understanding requirements throughout the lifecycle of a cloud migration project. It highlights the role of continuous requirement gathering in identifying the end-to-end functionality, the involvement of IT teams, and the process of aligning technical solutions with business goals. By examining the key components of requirement engineering in the cloud computing domain, this research aims to offer valuable insights into the best practices for ensuring the success of cloud data migration initiatives.
